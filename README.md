Tired of inconsistent knockback ruining your PvP experience? Our plugin recalculates knockback as if it were done clientside, leveling the playing field and ensuring every player enjoys a fair fight, no matter their connection quality.

Minecraft doesn’t factor in network latency when determining a player's actions on the server. This causes the server to receive outdated information that doesn’t reflect the player's clientside position, leading to varying knockback effects based on connection quality.

This plugin intercepts and adjusts knockback calculations to match what would occur clientside, effectively mitigating the disadvantages caused by high latency. By synchronizing knockback handling, we ensure that players experience consistent and fair knockback, providing a balanced and competitive environment for all."

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does this change put high ping players at a disadvantage?
**It depends on the player.** Some may notice a difference if they're used to relying on high ping to reduce knockback. For others, it could actually be an advantage.

### How does this change benefit high ping players?
**Knockback control.** For example, it will be easier to escape crit chains and punish crit.

### Why was the configurability of ping offset removed?
**It promotes consistency across all servers.** Extensive testing with top players has shown that an offset of 25 provides a balanced experience for everyone.

### How do I change the ping offset?
**You must run a modified build of KnockbackSync.** The variable can be changed inside of the [PlayerData](common/src/main/java/me/caseload/knockbacksync/player/PlayerData.java) class.

### /knockbacksync ping [target]

**Description:**

This command allows you to check the ping of a player, including jitter. If no target is specified, it will check your own ping.

* If a pong packet has been received:  "Your last ping packet took [ping]ms. Jitter: [jitter]ms." or "[Player]'s last ping packet took [ping]ms. Jitter: [jitter]ms."
* If a pong packet has not been received: "Pong not received. Your estimated ping is [estimated ping]ms." or "Pong not received. [Player]'s estimated ping is [estimated ping]ms."

**Notes:**

* The estimated ping is based on the player's platform reported ping.
* Jitter represents the variation in ping over time.

### /knockbacksync status [target]

**Description:**

This command allows you to check the KnockbackSync status of a player or the server. If no target is specified, it will show both the global status and your own status.

**Examples:**

* `/knockbacksync status`: Shows the global status and your own status.
